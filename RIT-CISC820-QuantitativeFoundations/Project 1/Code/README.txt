This project has two main components:


|-- determine_feature.m  (choose which feature to use)

|-- final_model.m  (use the chosen feature to train the final model)

|-- pred_Y.txt  (the prediction results of the testinputs.txt)


This project also includes "mean_error_data" to show the mean cross validation error of possible degrees (below 3).


To reproduce the result, just run the final_model.m file in Matlab. It will print the training error and predicted Y list.
